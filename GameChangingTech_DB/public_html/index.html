						<p class="imgtitle">An early Benz automobile.</p>
						<p>The history of the automobile is very rich and dates back to the 15th century when 
						Leonardo da Vinci was creating designs and models for transport vehicles. </p>
						<p>There are many different types of automobiles - steam, electric, and gasoline - as well as countless styles. 
						Exactly who invented the automobile is a matter of opinion. If we had to give credit 
						to one inventor, it would probably be Karl Benz from Germany. 
						Many suggest that he created the first true automobile in 1885/1886.</p>
						<p>By definition an automobile or car is a wheeled vehicle that carries its own motor and transports passengers. 
						The automobile as we know it was not invented in a single day by a single inventor. The history of the automobile reflects an 
						evolution that took place worldwide.</p>
