						<h2> History of walkman </h2>
							<span>The Walkman was launched in the year 1979 and now it's been almost 3 decades. 
							This revolutionary device was one of its kind. Although it was not welcomed by 
							everyone, but 80's and 90's saw the rising popularity mostly amongst the youngsters. 
							After the invent of the Compact disc "CD" as we all know, Sony launched its first portable
							CD player. CDs were better than cassettes both in sound quality and quantity 
							as it stored more songs than a music cassette.</span>
